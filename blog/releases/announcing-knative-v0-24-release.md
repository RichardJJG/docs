- For Serving, the recommended way to delete a Knative installation is to run
`kubectl delete -f serving-core.yaml` and other release YAMLs you might have applied.
- For Eventing, you must run the storage migration tool after the upgrade to migrate from v1beta2 to v1 `pingsources.sources.knative.dev` resources.
- For Eventing, there are new experimental features and a new process for trying them out.
- For Client, a new option `--env-value-from` was added to `kn service create` and
`kn service update` to allow referencing values from secrets and config maps.
The order of environment variables is now kept according to the order that `--env` related options
are provided on the command line.


### Serving v0.24

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/tag/v0.24.0 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

* **Renaming of some `net-*` components**
    Related issue: [knative/networking#448](https://github.com/knative/networking/issues/448)

    As part of our efforts to GA/1.0 we've standardized on the naming of our networking plugins that
    are installed alongside Serving. If you're managing your Knative deployment manually with
    `kubectl` **this will require a two-phase upgrade process**. See the below sections:

    Upgrade of [net-http01 to v0.24.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-http01/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

        ```
        # Apply the new release
        $ kubectl apply -f net-http01.yaml

        # Once the deployment is ready delete the old resources
        $ kubectl delete deployment http01-controller -n knative-serving
        $ kubectl delete service challenger -n knative-serving
        ```

    Upgrade of [net-certmanager to v0.24.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-certmanager/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

        ```
        # Apply the new release
        $ kubectl apply -f net-certmanager.yaml

        # Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but
        # prune the old resources
        $ kubectl apply -f net-certmanager.yaml \
          --prune -l networking.knative.dev/certificate-provider=cert-manager
        ```

    Upgrade [net-istio to v0.24.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

        ```
        # Apply the new release
        $ kubectl apply -f net-istio.yaml

        # Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but
        # prune the old resources
        $ kubectl apply -f net-istio.yaml \
          --prune -l networking.knative.dev/ingress-provider=istio
        ```

    Upgrade of [net-contour to v0.24.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

        ```
        # Apply the new release
        $ kubectl apply -f net-contour.yaml

        # Once the deployment is ready apply the same file but
        # prune the old resources
        $ kubectl apply -f net-contour.yaml \
          --prune -l networking.knative.dev/ingress-provider=contour
        ```

    Upgrade of [net-kourier to v0.24.0](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/releases/tag/v0.24.0)
    At this point we've deferred the renaming to net-kourier until the next release.
    We're looking to ensure there is no traffic disruption as part of the upgrade.
    Therefore upgrading to v0.24.0 requires no special instructions.

* **Kubernetes 1.19 is now required**

    As part of our
    [Kubernetes Minimum Version Principle](https://github.com/knative/community/blob/main/mechanics/RELEASE-VERSIONING-PRINCIPLES.md#k8s-minimum-version-principle)
    we now have a hard requirement on Kubernetes Version 1.19.

* **Webhook/Controller RBAC changes**

    The recommended way to delete a Knative installation is to run
    `kubectl delete -f serving-core.yaml` and other release YAMLs you might have applied.
    There's been a misconception that deleting the `knative-serving` namespace performs a
    similar cleanup but this does not remove cluster-scoped resources.
    In prior releases the cluster state would have _prevented_ the reinstall of Knative Serving.
    We've addressed this problem, but it requires some RBAC permissions on namespaces and
    finalizers.

    See the relevant issues and PRs below:

        * Original issue: [knative/pkg#2044](https://github.com/knative/pkg/issues/2044)
        * Workaround: [knative/pkg#2098](https://github.com/knative/pkg/pull/2098)
        * `knative-serving-core` cluster role has requires permission for namespaces/finalizers: [#11517](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11517)

* **DomainMapping feature is now BETA**

    This means it is built in to the main `serving-core` YAML by default.
    It is still possible to opt out of the feature by setting replica count of the
    domainmapping-controller to zero.

    As part of this transition the default value for autocreateClusterDomainClaims in the
    `config-network` config map was changed to false, meaning cluster-wide permissions are
    required to delegate the ability to create particular DomainMappings to namespaces.
    Single tenant clusters may wish to allow arbitrary users to create Domain Mappings by changing
    this value back to `true`. ([#11573](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11573))

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

* Allow dropping capabilities from a container's security context ([#11344](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11344))
* DomainMapping can now specify a TLS secret to be used as the HTTPS certificate ([#11250](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11250)
* Provides a feature gate that, when enabled, allows adding capabilities from a container's security context ([#11410](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11410))
* `defaultExternalScheme` can now be used to default routes to surface a URL scheme of your choice rather than the default "http". ([#11480](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11480))
* Optimized generated routes to minimize Envoy configuration size ([net-istio#632](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-istio/pull/632))
* Rename Contonr's ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to differ from existing contour installation ([net-contour#500](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-contour/pull/500))
* Add a new ConfigMap `config-kourier`, with the initial `enable-service-access-logging` setting ([net-kourier#523](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/net-kourier/pull/523))

#### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where traffic was briefly routed 'wrong', leading to errors due to exceeded
queues in deployments with a large activator count and a low service Pod count. ([#11375](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11375))
* Traffic status in Route is updated whenever traffic configuration was wrong. ([#11477](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11477))
* Validates, consistently with other configmaps, that the `_example` section of the features
ConfigMap is not accidentally modified. ([#11391](https://github.com/knative/serving/pull/11391))


### Eventing v0.24

<!-- Original notes are here: https://github.com/knative/eventing/releases/tag/v0.24.1 -->

#### üö® Breaking or Notable Changes

* You must run the storage migration tool after the upgrade to migrate from v1beta2 to v1 `pingsources.sources.knative.dev` resources. ([#5381](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5381))

#### üí´ New Features & Changes

We're glad to announce that we have introduced a new process to test and develop new features,
called the [experimental features process](https://github.com/knative/eventing/blob/a574b7ba95b9c8d4743ba3ee12184c39e0415d87/docs/experimental-features.md).

Thanks to this process, you are able to try out the new amazing features and provide feedback back to the project!

We're introducing two experimental features to begin with:

* `kreference-group`: When using `ref`, refer to resources using only the API Group, and not the full API Version.
* `delivery-timeout`: When using the `delivery`, define per request timeout.

You can read more about how to enable these features and their usage in the
[experimental feature documentation](https://dev-knative.netlify.app/development/eventing/experimental-features/).

* `KReference.Group` now can be used in `Subscription.Spec.Channel` as well ([#5520](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5520))
* Added `DeliverySpec.Timeout` ([#5149](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5149))
* Added the experimental feature kreference-group.
By enabling it, you can use Subscriber.Ref.Group instead of Subscriber.Ref.APIVersion to refer to another Resource, without being explicit about the resource version (for example, v1beta1, v1, ...) ([#5440](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5440))
* Remaining HA Control Plane Pods (through the operator) are now labeled with podAntiAffinity to ensure there isn't a single point of failure. ([#5409](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5409))


#### üêû Bug Fixes

* Fixed a race condition with apiserversources reported ready before they have begun listening for events ([#5446](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5446))
* Imc-controller cluster role now has update permission for namespaces/finalizers. ([#5539](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5539))
* Knative-eventing-webhook cluster role has update permission for namespaces/finalizers. ([#5501](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5501))


#### üßπ Clean up

* Subscription.Spec.Channel now uses KReference and the spec.channel CRD schema is less permissive and matches the supported usage of KReference fields.
Subscription's users creating their resources with YAMLs are not affected. ([#5412](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5412))
* The PingSource adapter now generates a normal event instead of a warning when the source is not ready. Rename the event to PingSourceSkipped.
    * The PingSource adapter now generates the normal event PingSourceSynchronized when it has been synchronized. ([#5549](https://github.com/knative/eventing/pull/5549))
